# ThreeGoodThings
"Three Good Things" is an android application for doing a positive psychology exercise.

The application allows the user to keep a diary of three good things that he/she experienced a particular day.

The date of the day and the three good things of the day are stored permanently in an SQLite database. 

The application allows the user to add an entry to the diary, but also updates an entry (change good things/date) or even deletes an entry. 

The application allows only one entry for a particular date.
